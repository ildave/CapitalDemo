/* 
 * The original ControlLogic architecture (as imported from Simulink) is extended here with a variant. Depending on which feature model (simple vs. advanced headlight control) is selected, the car detected signal (coming from the CarDetection block) will be omitted (simple control) or not (advanced control).
